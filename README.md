# LLM Openness Matrix

> A simple approach and matrix to evluate the leven of openness of Large Language Models.

The assessment approach and matrix come from the series of articles *[How Open is Generative AI?](https://dev.to/worldlinetech/how-open-is-generative-ai-part-1-7cp)*

## Assessment framework

The main components and aspects of a LLM to check when assessing its openness are the following:
- The model and its weights
- The dataset used for pre-training
- The dataset used for fine-tuning (if not a foundational model)
- The reward model used for the RLHF phase (if not a foundational model)
- The data processing code

On each of these aspects we then evaluate the level of openness with one of the following scores:
- Score 0 - Closed: No access to any public information, data or asset
- Score 1 - Published research only: Research papers(s) published but with no more information, data or asset
- Score 2 - Restricted access: Access to asset is possible only with special agreement (commercial, researchâ€¦)
- Score 3 - Open with limitations: Access and reuse of asset is possible but with certain limitations on usage (ex. Open RAIL license)
- Score 4 - Totally open: Access and reuse of asset is possible without restriction (ex. open source license)
